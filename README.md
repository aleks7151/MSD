In my opinion, there was one important inaccuracy in this task - Can one cow have one child or many children?
But when i saw the requirement NOT to use any arrays in the second part, I decided that one cow should have only one child. Otherwise without using array it is imposible to store many children in a cow without using crutches (for example store children in a file). I hope i understood correctly what was meant.

All main classes methods are covered by tests.
In the code in a complex method i wrote comment to make easier to understand
